# Project ARNA

Project ARNA (Amateur Radio Network Appliance) is a research project that aims to deploy a large number of anycast nodes that provide various services to the amateur radio community. 

The set of services will change over time as different experiments are run. The current set of services are:

- APRS core servers
- Echolink proxies

## Joining the project
